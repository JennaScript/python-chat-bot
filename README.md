Pocket Pen Pal
Created by Jennalyn Kabiling 
Version Python 3.8.5 

This chat bot was designed to simulate as if a user were writing to a pen pal from somewhere else in the world! The user can choose where they want their pen pal to be from and from there, the virtual pen pal will discuss what they are doing in their city of the userâ€™s choice. 

DISCLAIMER: There is no human interaction whatsoever, all of the responses to user inputs will be completely fictional and also simulated through a program.
