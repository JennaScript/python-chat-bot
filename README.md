Pocket Pen Pal
Created by Jennalyn Kabiling 
Built with Python 3.8.5 

BETA Version - still not a complete chat bot just yet :)

This simple chat bot is designed to simulate as if a user were writing to a pen pal from somewhere else in the world! The user can choose where they want their pen pal to be from and from there, the virtual pen pal will chat with the user.

DISCLAIMER: There is no human interaction whatsoever, all of the responses to user inputs will be completely fictional and also simulated through a program.
